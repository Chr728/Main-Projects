Q4
1. ? field(heat_transfer,engineering).
The answer is true  , queries ground
Steps: 
course(heat_transfer, mechanical),field(mechanical,engineering).

2. lab_number(fine_arts,X).
The answer is X= 10  , queries non  ground
Steps: 
lab_number(fine_arts,10).
X=10


3. ? field(computer, literature).
The answer is False , queries ground
Steps:
course(computer, Z).  
False 

4. ? course(X,Y).
The answer is X=heat_transfer , Y = mechanical  , queries  non ground
Steps:
course(heat_transfer, mechanical).
	X=heat_transfer , Y = mechanical
if we continue putting ";"
then we get all of them so becomes
X = heat_transfer,
Y = mechanical ;
X = web_design,
Y = computer ;
X = design_methods,
Y = fine-arts ;
X = poetry,
Y = literature.

8. ? student(X, fine-arts), course(fine_arts, Y).  
The answer is   False, queries Ground
Steps:
student(X, fine-arts).
field(X, fine-arts).
course(heat_transfer, mechanical).
field(mechanical, fine-arts). this step fails
course(web_design, computer).
field(computer, fine-arts). this step fails
course(design_methods, fine-arts).
field(fine-arts, fine-arts). this step fails
course(poetry, literature).
field(literature, fine-arts). this step fails
student(_, fine-arts). this step fails
False.

9. ? field(_, X).
The answer is  X = engineering , queries  non Ground
Steps:
field(mechanical, engineering).
	X = engineering . 
if user keps putting the ";"
then we get all of them one by one so becomes
X = engineering ;
X = engineering ;
X = art ;
X = social ;
X = business ;
X = engineering ;
X = engineering ;
X = art ;
X = social ;



10. lab_number(_,X), field(X,Y).
The answer is   False, queries Ground
Steps:
lab_number(mechanical, 15).
course(15, Z). this step fails
field(15, Y). this step fails
lab_number(fine_arts, 10).
course(10, Z). this step fails

course(heat_transfer, mechanical).
lab_number(mechanical, 15).
course(15, Z). this step fails
field(15, Y). this step fails
lab_number(mechanical, 15). this step fails
course(web_design, computer).
lab_number(computer, Z). this step fails
course(design_methods, fine-arts).
lab_number(fine-arts, Z). this step fails
course(poetry, literature).
lab_number(literature, Z). this step fails
lab_number(_,X).this step fails
False. 


11. ? lab_number(X, 15), field(X, Y).
The answer is   X = mechanical Y = engineering	 , queries non Ground
if user keep putting ";" then we get
X = mechanical,
Y = engineering ;
X = heat_transfer,
Y = engineering ;
Steps:
lab_number(mechanical,15).
	field(mechanical,engineering).
X = mechanical.
Y = engineering		


12. student(X), !, student(X,_)

steps:
student(X,_).
student(john, heat_transfer).
student(john, heat_transfer).
X = john.
 

14. ? course(X,_), \+ student(_,X). % \+ is for negation (not)
The answer is   false, queries  Ground
