1. food(bread, X) = Food(Y, soup)
Answer:It will not unify since prolog is case sensitive causing a Syntax error.
2. Bread = soup
Answer: It will unify since they are equivalent to each other(variable Bread = soup).

3. Bread = Soup
Answer: It will unify since Bread and Soup are variables that are equivalent to each other.

4. food(bread, X, milk) = food(Y, salad, X)
Answer: It will not unify because of X. Since, X has 2 different values which is incorrect.

5. manager(X) = Y
Answer: It will unify since Y = manager(X).

6. meal(healthyFood(bread), drink(milk)) = meal(X,Y)
Answer:It will unify since X = healthyFood(bread) and Y = drink(milk).

7. meal(eat(Z), drink(milk)) = [X]
Answer:It will not unify because meal is not a list, and [X] is a list.

8. [eat(Z), drink(milk)] = [X, Y | Z]
Answer: It will unify since Z = [], X = eat([]) and Y = drink(milk).

9. f(X, t(b, c)) = f(l, t(Z, c))
Answer: It will unify since X = 1 and Z = b.

10. ancestor(french(jean), B) = ancestor(A, scottish(joe))
Answer: It will unify since B = scottish(joe) and A = fresh(jean).

11. meal(healthyFood(bread), Y) = meal(X, drink(water))
Answer:It will unify since X = healthyFood(bread) and Y = drink(water).

12. [H|T] = [a, b, c]
Answer: It will unify, since H = a and T = [b,c].

13. [H, T] = [a, b, c]
Answer: It will not unify since the Left hand side has 2 elements and the Right hand side has 3 element list.

14. breakfast(healthyFood(bread), egg, milk) = breakfast(healthyFood(Y), Y, Z)
Answer:It will not unify since Y is repeated twice, with different values that means it is incorrect.

15. dinner(X, Y, Time) = dinner(jack, cook( egg, oil), Evening)
Answer: It will unify since X = jack, Y = cook(egg, oil) and Time = Evening.

16. k(s(g), Y) = k(X, t(k))
Answer:It will unify since X = s(g) and Y = t(k).

17. equation(Z, f(x, 17, M), L*M, 17) = equation(C, f(D, D, y), C, E)
Answer: It will not unify. D has two different values, which are X and 17 which is incorrect.

18. a(X, b(c, d), [H|T]) = a(X, b(c, X), b)
Answer:It will not unify since [H|T] is a list and b is not a list.
